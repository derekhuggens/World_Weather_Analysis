# World_Weather_Analysis

## Using APIs to help travelers build a vacation itinerary.

###

In this repository, three folders contain the necessary code to:

  * Generate random latitudes and longitudes, locate nearest cities to those coordinates, perform API calls for weather in those cities.
  * Receive temperature input based on travel needs.
  * Procure cities and their nearby hotels, based on latitude and longitudes, that match customer temperature requirements.
  * Show nearby hotels on Google Maps with pop-up markers.
  * Use Google's Directions API to create a travel itinerary showing a potential route for four chosen hotels.
